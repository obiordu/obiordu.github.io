> a. **Setting up a github account**

Like with most things on this site, i will point in the right direction to documentation and only spell out areas where i believe i or anyone could be confused.

The site can be found here @ [github][github]

> b. *Activating github pages for organization account or organization project*

The welcome page for github pages is very helpful and i dare say, playful. It can be found by clicking the link [github pages][githubpages]

> c. *Use Themes and activate for all markdown (.md) files created*
