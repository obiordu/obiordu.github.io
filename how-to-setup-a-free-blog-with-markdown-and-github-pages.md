##### 1. Setting up a github account
#
Like with most things on this site, i will point in the right direction to documentation and only spell out areas where i believe i or anyone could be confused.

The site can be found here @ [github.com][github]
#
#
#
##### 2. Activating github pages for organization account or organization project
#
The welcome page for github pages is very helpful and i dare say, playful. It can be found by clicking the link [pages.github.com][githubpages]
#

#
##### 3. Use Themes and activate for all markdown (.md) files created
